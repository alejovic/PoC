# Proof of Concept - [Dropwizard]

# Dropwizard 2.1.11 with JDBI
---

üß† **What is org.jdbi.v3?**
JDBI stands for Java Database Interface.

It‚Äôs a wrapper around JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) that makes it easier to work with databases in Java.

‚úÖ It makes it easy to execute SQL from Java
‚úÖ It avoids a lot of boilerplate (like manually writing JDBC connection, statement, resultset handling, etc.)
‚úÖ It maps query results into Java objects (POJOs) automatically
‚úÖ It fits perfectly with Dropwizard ‚Äî that's why Dropwizard has dropwizard-jdbi3 module built-in.

# ‚ö° Characteristics of **Dropwizard 2.1.11**

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Java version** | Java 8 minimum (Java 11 highly recommended) |
| **Core modules** | REST server (Jetty), Jackson (JSON), Jersey (JAX-RS), Hibernate (optional ORM), JDBI3 (SQL mapping), Metrics, Logging |
| **Architecture style** | Microservice / REST API-centric, simple startup |
| **Configuration** | YAML-driven (`config.yml`) |
| **Opinionated** | Batteries included ‚Äî chooses libraries for you |
| **Jersey** | JAX-RS 2.1 (through Jersey 2.x) |
| **Metrics** | Built-in Metrics (Dropwizard Metrics library) |
| **Database** | Supports Hibernate ORM (via `dropwizard-hibernate`) and JDBI (via `dropwizard-jdbi3`) |
| **Health Checks** | Easy to implement service health monitoring |
| **Testing** | Built-in support with Dropwizard testing helpers |
| **Security** | Basic OAuth/JWT support via extensions |
| **Packaging** | Single **fat jar** runnable by `java -jar` |
| **Third-party Bundles** | e.g., Swagger integration (`dropwizard-swagger`) available |
| **Deployment** | Meant to be simple ‚Äî no container required (Jetty embedded) |

# ‚ö° Limitations / Drawbacks of **Dropwizard 2.1.11**

| Limitation | Details |
|:-----------|:--------|
| **Not modular** | All components bundled together ‚Äî harder to customize compared to Spring Boot |
| **Tight integration to Jersey** | Only supports Jersey ‚Äî no easy switch to other REST frameworks |
| **No built-in Dependency Injection framework** | No Spring-style DI (uses constructor injection manually) |
| **Startup** | Slower startup than Micronaut/Quarkus (but fine for most APIs) |
| **Front-end support** | Only server-side APIs ‚Äî no native templating or frontend solutions (like Thymeleaf) |
| **Hibernate support** | Hibernate is optional but a bit dated ‚Äî Hibernate Validator and Hibernate ORM are based on older Jakarta EE packages (`javax.*`) |
| **No AOT / Native compilation** | Unlike Micronaut or Quarkus, no GraalVM native image support without big tweaks |
| **Limited "magic"** | Very explicit ‚Äî you write more configuration manually (good or bad depending on you!) |
| **Java 17+ needs upgrade** | If you want Java 17 officially, you should move to Dropwizard 3.x (2.x is not Java 17-certified) |

# üßê Realistic Use Cases

**When Dropwizard 2.1.11 is great:**
- REST APIs
- Microservices
- Lightweight backend applications
- Internal tools and admin backends
- You like **simple**, **explicit** frameworks (less "magic" than Spring Boot)

**When Dropwizard 2.1.11 might not be ideal:**
- Big, complex enterprise systems needing lots of modularity, dynamic beans
- Native image build targets (GraalVM)
- Heavy UI-based apps
- Reactive systems (non-blocking IO)

# üöÄ Summary

‚úÖ Fast to build REST APIs  
‚úÖ Great metrics/monitoring built-in  
‚úÖ Simple packaging and deployment  
‚úÖ Stable and mature  
‚ö†Ô∏è Not cutting-edge (no native builds, not modular)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Tied to Jersey, no alternate REST libraries  
‚ö†Ô∏è No fancy Dependency Injection

How to start the dropwizard application
---

1. Run `mvn clean install` to build your application
2. Start application with `java -jar target/sample-app-jdbi-2.1.11-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml`
3. To check that your application is running enter url `http://localhost:8080`
4. To test the API, you can use a tool like `curl` or Postman. For example, to create a new person, you can use the following `curl` command:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/persons \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id":1,"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}'
     
curl http://localhost:8080/persons/1

curl http://localhost:8080/persons
```
Health Check

To see your applications health enter url `http://localhost:8081/healthcheck`
