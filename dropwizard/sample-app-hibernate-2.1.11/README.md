# Dropwizard 2.1.11 with Hibernate

# üåê JDBI vs Hibernate

| Feature | **JDBI** | **Hibernate** |
|:--------|:---------|:--------------|
| **Type** | SQL-mapping library | Full ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) |
| **Goal** | Map SQL queries directly to Java objects | Abstract away SQL entirely via entities and sessions |
| **Ease of Use** | Very simple for small apps; you write SQL yourself | More complex; config-heavy; "magic" behind the scenes |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium to High |
| **Performance** | Faster for simple queries (no heavy ORM overhead) | Good but might add some overhead due to session management, lazy loading, etc. |
| **Transaction Management** | Manual or via extensions | Automatic session/transaction management built-in |
| **Complex Queries** | Manual SQL or fluent APIs | HQL/JPQL abstraction over SQL |
| **Schema Management** | You must create tables manually or use migration tools (Flyway, Liquibase) | Can auto-generate schema with `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` |
| **Caching** | No caching by default | Built-in first-level and second-level cache options |
| **Use Case** | Lightweight APIs, microservices, direct DB control | Complex business apps with many relationships and entities |
| **Popular Use Cases** | REST APIs, microservices, quick prototypes | Enterprise systems, layered architecture, complex domain models |

# üöÄ Quick Summary

- **Use JDBI** if you want **full SQL control**, **simplicity**, and **microservice speed**.
- **Use Hibernate** if you need **heavy domain modeling**, **lazy loading**, **caching**, and want to **abstract away SQL**.

---

# üí° Bonus Tip

You can actually use **both together** in the same app ‚Äî use Hibernate for complex entity management and JDBI for direct, fine-tuned SQL queries where needed!

# ‚ö° Characteristics of **Dropwizard 2.1.11**

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Java version** | Java 8 minimum (Java 11 highly recommended) |
| **Core modules** | REST server (Jetty), Jackson (JSON), Jersey (JAX-RS), Hibernate (optional ORM), JDBI3 (SQL mapping), Metrics, Logging |
| **Architecture style** | Microservice / REST API-centric, simple startup |
| **Configuration** | YAML-driven (`config.yml`) |
| **Opinionated** | Batteries included ‚Äî chooses libraries for you |
| **Jersey** | JAX-RS 2.1 (through Jersey 2.x) |
| **Metrics** | Built-in Metrics (Dropwizard Metrics library) |
| **Database** | Supports Hibernate ORM (via `dropwizard-hibernate`) and JDBI (via `dropwizard-jdbi3`) |
| **Health Checks** | Easy to implement service health monitoring |
| **Testing** | Built-in support with Dropwizard testing helpers |
| **Security** | Basic OAuth/JWT support via extensions |
| **Packaging** | Single **fat jar** runnable by `java -jar` |
| **Third-party Bundles** | e.g., Swagger integration (`dropwizard-swagger`) available |
| **Deployment** | Meant to be simple ‚Äî no container required (Jetty embedded) |

# ‚ö° Limitations / Drawbacks of **Dropwizard 2.1.11**

| Limitation | Details |
|:-----------|:--------|
| **Not modular** | All components bundled together ‚Äî harder to customize compared to Spring Boot |
| **Tight integration to Jersey** | Only supports Jersey ‚Äî no easy switch to other REST frameworks |
| **No built-in Dependency Injection framework** | No Spring-style DI (uses constructor injection manually) |
| **Startup** | Slower startup than Micronaut/Quarkus (but fine for most APIs) |
| **Front-end support** | Only server-side APIs ‚Äî no native templating or frontend solutions (like Thymeleaf) |
| **Hibernate support** | Hibernate is optional but a bit dated ‚Äî Hibernate Validator and Hibernate ORM are based on older Jakarta EE packages (`javax.*`) |
| **No AOT / Native compilation** | Unlike Micronaut or Quarkus, no GraalVM native image support without big tweaks |
| **Limited "magic"** | Very explicit ‚Äî you write more configuration manually (good or bad depending on you!) |
| **Java 17+ needs upgrade** | If you want Java 17 officially, you should move to Dropwizard 3.x (2.x is not Java 17-certified) |

# üßê Realistic Use Cases

**When Dropwizard 2.1.11 is great:**
- REST APIs
- Microservices
- Lightweight backend applications
- Internal tools and admin backends
- You like **simple**, **explicit** frameworks (less "magic" than Spring Boot)

**When Dropwizard 2.1.11 might not be ideal:**
- Big, complex enterprise systems needing lots of modularity, dynamic beans
- Native image build targets (GraalVM)
- Heavy UI-based apps
- Reactive systems (non-blocking IO)

# üöÄ Summary

‚úÖ Fast to build REST APIs  
‚úÖ Great metrics/monitoring built-in  
‚úÖ Simple packaging and deployment  
‚úÖ Stable and mature  
‚ö†Ô∏è Not cutting-edge (no native builds, not modular)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Tied to Jersey, no alternate REST libraries  
‚ö†Ô∏è No fancy Dependency Injection

How to start the dropwizard application
---

1. Run `mvn clean install` to build your application
2. Start application with `java -jar target/sample-app-hibernate-2.1.11-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml`
3. To check that your application is running enter url `http://localhost:8080`
4. To test the API, you can use a tool like `curl` or Postman. For example, to create a new person, you can use the following `curl` command:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/persons \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}'
     
curl http://localhost:8080/persons/1

curl http://localhost:8080/persons
```
Health Check

To see your applications health enter url `http://localhost:8081/healthcheck`
